<font size="10">P</font>rime Minister Narendra Modi started off his second day in Chennai by helping
clean up the Mamallapuram beach.
</p>
<p>
PM Modi on Saturday tweeted a video where he is seen plogging -- collecting plastic
and putting it in a bag which he later handed over to a hotel staff standing nearby.
</p>
<p>
Plogging is a Swedish concept that emerged out of environmental concerns over
plastic pollution where people jog on streets while picking up litter, hence promoting
cleanliness.
</p>
<p>
Keeping in vein with his Swachh Bharat mission, PM Modi plogged on the beaches of
Mamallapuram on the second day of his informal meeting with Chinese President Xi
Jinping. He captioned his tweet with a message urging people to <b>"ensure our public
places are clean and tidy."</b>
</p>
<p>
Let us also ensure we remain fit and healthy, PM Modi’s tweet added.
</p>
<p>
Lauding PM Modi for his attempt to promote the plogging concept, Union Sports
Minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted, When the Prime Minister leads from the front, the whole
nation moves along! Plogging is the best way to improve overall fitness and cleanliness
together.
</p>
<p>
Encouraging people to take up plogging, Kiren Rijiju said, <b>"Plogging run burns 15 per
cent to 30 per cent more calories than traditional jogging while waste collection
becomes a glamorous lifestyle!"</b>
</p>
<p>
PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Chennai on Friday to hold the
second informal summit.
</p>
<p>
The prime minister chose Mamallapuram as the venue for the second informal summit
to stress on the civilisational ties between India and China going back over 2,000 years.
</p>
<p>
As all eyes are on Modi-Xi meet, PM Modi did not miss this opportunity to spread a
word about cleanliness and his campaign to ban single-use plastic.
</p>
<p>
PM Modi had been concerned about the issue of hygiene and cleanliness in the
country. He first launched Swatchch Bharat Abhiyaan which gathered a wide support
from the citizens. He even conferred the <b>'Global Goalkeeper Award’</b> at the United
Nations for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by his government.
