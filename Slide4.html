<h1>
Researchers discover lost '8th continent' under Europe and no,it's not Atlantis
</h1>
<p>
Dubbed 'Greater Adria' by its founders ,the lost continent,hidden in the Mediterrarean region,
is the size of Greenland.

<font size="20">G</font>eologists have discovered a new continent hidden in the Mediterranean region after analysing all the 
mountain ranges from Spain to Iran in detail for 10 years.
</p>
<p>
The research,publishedin the journal Gondwana Research,releaved how a piece of continential crust 
the size of Greenland that once seperated from North Africa plunged into the Earth's mantle under Southern Europe.

8th continent of Earth:Greater Adria
</font>
</h1>
<p>
Billed the eighth continent on Earth,this piece of continent crust is called <b>'Greater Adria'</b>.
<b>"Most mountain chains that we investigated originated from a single continent that separated from North Africa more than 200 million years
ago,"</b> said principal researcher Douwe van Hinsbergen ,Professor at Utrecht University,Netherlands.
</p>
<p>
<b>"The only remaining part of this continent is a strip that runs from Turin via the Adriatic Sea to the heel of the boot that forms Italy,"</b>Van Hinsbergen said.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>"Forget Atlantis.Without realising it, vast numbers of tourists spend their holiday each year on the lost continent of Greater Adria,"Van Hinsbergen added.</b>
</blockquote>

What took so long to discover Greater Adria?
</font>
</h1>
<p>
Most of the continent was situated underwater and formed shallow ,tropical seas in which sediment deposited ,for example in large coral reefs.
</p>
<p>
The sedimentary rocks ,in particular ,were scraped off when the rest of the rest of the continent
subduced into the mantle.
</p>
<b>
<p>These scrapings are now the mountains of the Apennines,parts  of the Aips,the Balkans,Greece and Turkey,the study said.
</p>
</b>
<p>
The reconstruction was a collaboration between geologists from Utrecht,oslo and Zurich.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>
"This is not only a large region,but it also hosts more than 30 countries.Each of these has its own geological
survey,own maps and own ideas about the evolutionary history,"Van Hinsbergen said while explaining why it 
took reseachers so long for the discovery.
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
With their reconstruction of teh lost Greater Adria,the geologists have made a substantial contribution to fundamental
knowledge about mountain range formation.
</p>
<p>
For the reconstruction of this region ,the geologists made use of the advanced plate 
tectonic reconstruction software Gplates.
