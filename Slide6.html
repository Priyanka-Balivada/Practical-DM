Surface melting causes Antarctic glaciers to slip faster towards the ocean

<p>
As per the latest study,the water from melting Antarctic glaciers rapidly 
accelerating further thawing of the continent's ice sheets towards the sea.

<font size="20">T</font>he water from melting Antarctic glaciers,flowing through
the ice and beneath them,is rapidly accelerating further thawing of the continent's ice sheets
towards the sea,according to a study.The study,published in the journal Nature Communications,
is the first time researchers have found that melting on the surface impacts the flow of glaciers in Antarctica.

What did the researchers found out?
</font>
</h1>
<p>
Ultimately, the researches said that glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula would
behave like those in present-day Greenland and Alaska,where meltwater controls
the size and timing of variations in glacier flow across seasons and years.
</p>
<p>
<b>"Our research shows for the first time that surface meltwater is getting beneath glaciers
in the Antarctic Peninsula causing short bursts of sliding towards the seas 100 percent 
faster than normal,"</b>said co-author Jeremey Ely of the University of Sheffield.
</p>
<p>
The researchers said that they expect to see more surface meltwater then ever with increasing 
global average temperatures,adding that such behaviour may become more common in Antarctica.
</p>
<p>
<b>"It's crucial that this factor is considered in models of future sea-level rise,
so we can prepare for a world with fewer and smaller glaciers,"</b>Ely added.The discovery ,according to
co-author Pete Tuckett of the University of Sheffield,could have significant implications for the future rates of sea-level rise.
