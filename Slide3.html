<font size="20">T</font>his year,the World Federation for Mental Health(WFMH) has decided to make
<b>'suicide prevention' </b>the main theme of World Mental Health Day 2019.According 
to WHO,moore than 800,000 people die by suicide a year, making it the principal cause of death among people 15
to 19 years olds.
</p>
<p>
The objective of making suicide prevention the theme of World Health Day in 2019 is to
attract the attention of governments so that the issue migt be given priority in public health agendas
around the world.
</p>
<p>
Since there is no specific age for one encountering issues of mental illness hence depression ,anxiety and stress
have become a rampant problem among Indians.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays people experience enormous stress due to strained financial conditiond,
workplace and tensed relationships,hence making India one of the most depressed
countries in the world.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>
"6.5 percent of the Indian popoulation suffers from some form of serious mental disorder.It shows mental health is emerging
as a widespeard disease," said Clinical Psychologist of Columbia Asia Hospital,Dr. Shweta Sharma.
</blockquote>
</b>
<p>
<b>
"The serious issue is that there is no particular age group for this disorder,it can affect anybody,"</b>
 Sharma added.
</p>
<p>
With the treatment of mental health disorders being the need of the hour,Dr Shweta suggested that 
other than common people ,policymakers should also be encouraged to promote the
availability and access to cost-effective treatment of common mental disorders at the primary health 
care level.

<p>
Based on a report from the World Health Oraganization(WHO),depression 
will be the single biggest cause of ill health in the world by 2030.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>
The rising of suicide cases,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD)
, gaming addiction, and adolescent depression is increasing exponentially.
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The effect of stress not only shows upon one's mental health but adversely
influences physical wellbeing.
</p>
<p>
Since mental and emotional disturbance may gradually start showing its ill-effects
on physical and societal health ,founder of Srauta Wellness,Praveshh Gaur 
emphasised on the need of <b>"recognising and carrying large-scale campaigns
addressing the need to spread awareness ,develop empath and support towards 
the people who are struggling with a mental health problem."</b>
</p>

<h1>
It's okay to ask your children if they feel depressed
</h1>
</font>
<p>
While it's easy to find any mental disorder in adults ,for parents or caregivers it's hard
to find out if their child has been having any kind of stress,anxiety or depression.
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>
"In my clinical experience ,nine out of 10 parents are not aware that their 
child has been having this suicidal ideation,"Dr. Preeti Singh,Clinical
Psychology and Psychotheraphy from Paras Hospital.
</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Therefore,it's ok sometimes to even ask if they ever felt depressed or suicidal.
</p>
<p>
<b>
"Don't miss the signs in your young ones when they are feeling hopeless,
showing reckless behaviour like rash driving or unprotected sex ,poor self-care and hygiene,
talking about suicide or have no reasons to live,self harm behaviours,
increase alcohol or drugs, researching about ways to die,"</b> said Dr Preeti.
