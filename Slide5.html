Climate change may reduce the ability of soil to absorb water
</h1>
<p>
Climate change not only has effects on the ecosystem ,coasts ,etc,it also may reduce the 
ability of soil to absorb water.

<font size="20">C</font>limate change not only has catastrophic effects on coasts ,oceans ,ecosystems, weather, and human health but also largely impacting soil,say researchers.
Climate change may reduce the ability of soils to absorb water in many parts of the world,according to a study published in the journal,'Science Advances'.And that
could have serious implications for groundwater supplies,food production,and security,
stormwater runoff,biodiversity and ecosystems.

How water interacts with the soil could change appreciably in many parts of the world

The lead author of teh research is Joshua S Caplan,a former Rutgers postdoctoral
associate now at Temple University.Scientists at the University of California,Riverside,University of Kansas,
Kansas State University and Colorado State University also contributed to the study.

<b>"Since rainfall patterns and other environmental conditions are shifting globally as a
result of climate change,our results suggest that how water interacts with soil could
change appreciably in many parts of the world,and do so fairly rapidly,"</b>said co-author
Daniel Gimenez,a soil scientist and professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences
at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.
</p>
<p>
<b>
"We propose that the direction ,magnitude and rate of teh changes should be measured
and incorporated into predictions of ecosystems responses to climate change,"</b>added Gimenez.

<h1>
<font color="blue">
The biggest changes were linked to shifts in relatively large pores,or spaces ,in the soil
</font>
</h1>
<p>
Large pores capture water that plants and microorganisms can use, and that
contributes to enhanced biological activity and nutrient cycling in soil and decreases
soil losses through erosion.
</p>
<p>
With increased rainfall,plant communities had thicker roots that could clog larger pores and there
were less intense cycles of soil expansion when water was added or contraction when water was removed.
