Global biodiversity is in crisis,with tropical oceans hardest hit:Study

<p>
Biodiversity loss is happening at a faster rate in the tropical regions of the
world and the rate of species turnover in marine habitats was double that 
for land habitats.

<font size="20">B</font>iodiversity loss is happening at a faster rate in the tropical regions
of the world,with changes in marine ecosystems outpacing those on land ,according to a
study that can help prioritise global conservation strategies.
</p>
<p>
The findings of the study,published in the journal Science,revealed that there were both 
negative and positive changes in ecosystems across the world,and while on average the number of species
living in each place was not changing,many regions were either gaining or losing species.

Research methodology
</font>

</h1>
<p>
An international team of scientists,including those from McGill University in Canada,examined
the variation in species richness and composition across the Earth's longitudes.
</p>
<p>
The researches pieced together and mapped more than 50,000 data points on the chronological change in biodiversity
from studies across the planet using the database BioTime.
</p>
<p>According to the researchers,detecting geographic variation in biodiversity
trends could help policymakers prioritise conservation approaches by identifying which regions
to protect,and which places to help recover.

"Our study shows biodiversity ischanging everywhere ,but we are not losing biodiversity everywhere.Some places are recovering 
and adapting," said Maria Dornelas,lead author of the study from the University of St.Andrews in the UK.

Findings of the Study

</p>
<p>
While earlier studies had already established that human actions affected biodiversity with different timings and effects,Dornelas said that
researchers didn't have a clear understanding of the net effects of these actions across the planet.
</p>
<p>
<b>
"When biodiversity is in the news these days,it is often because the Amazon is on fire,or there is a global mass mortality
event in coral reefs,and rightly so,because these are terrifying news.However,there is a lot of energy also taking place silently
in the background ,and many places where not much is happening,"</b>Dornelas said.
</p>
<p>
The study also revealed taht marine ecosystems underwent the most rapid
transformations in biodiversity compared to all other habitats.
</p>
<p>
<b>
"The species that make up local assemblages are cahnging everywhere,but these changes are happening faster in marine compared to 
terrestrial assemblages,"</b>said Shane Blowes,first author of the study from the German Centre for Integrative
Biodiversity Research(/Div).
</p>
<p>
According to the study,while some locations have experienced decreases in the numbers of species,others show increases or little change
at all.
</p>
<p>
<b>
"More consistently,however, the identities of species appear to be changing at nearly all sites-this kind
of change is critical to planning conservation and management strategies,particularly for sites
exhibiting rapid turnover,"</b>said Sarah Supp,joint first author of the study from Denison University,US.
</p>
<p>
According to the researchers,our planet is undergoing a great geographic reorganisation of its biodiversity in response to human activities
and climate change,which they added will continue to happen for 
decades to come.
