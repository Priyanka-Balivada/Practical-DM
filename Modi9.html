<font size="10">I</font>f   he turned heads with his dhoti and angavastram on Friday, on Saturday,
a video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi walking barefoot, picking up
trash from the Kovalam beach after his morning walk, set off another social
media storm.
</p>
<p>
In his tweet, Mr. Modi said:<b>" Plogging at a beach in Mamallapuram this
morning. It lasted for over 30 minutes. Also handed over my ‘collection’ to
Jeyaraj, who is a part of the hotel staff. Let us ensure our public places are
clean and tidy! Let us also ensure we remain fit and healthy.”</b>
</p>
<p>
(Plogging is about runners (or walkers) picking up trash along the way, or
after their run/walk, and disposing it off responsibly.)
</p>
<p>
Responding to the tweet, fisherman K. Vinod of Ocean Awareness group,
who cleans fishing hamlets, said: <b>“When the Prime Minister can do it, why
can’t ordinary people too. ”</b>
</p>
<p>
Mamallapuram resident Aine Edwards had posted several photographs of
how clean the town and beach looked after the summit. <b>“It just shows that
the town has the potential to be clean. The humans, who cleaned it up so
beautifully, did a good job. But can they keep it that way?”</b> she asked.
</p>
<p>
However, there were those who criticised the PM’s exercise. Actor Prakash
Raj on Twitter said: <b>“Where is our LEADERs security.. Why have you left
him alone to clean with a CAMERAMAN following ....#justasking.”</b>
</p>
<p>
Kancheepuram District Collector P. Ponniah said the plastic must have
washed up onto the beach.<b> “Since the beach is visited by tourists, it is
usually kept clean. We had also cleaned up the beach before and during the
summit,”</b> he said.
