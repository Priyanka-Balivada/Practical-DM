<font size="10">M</font>amallapuram is all set for a makeover ahead of the high-level summit between
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. On Friday past
noon, the Chinese President will land at the Chennai airport and head off to a luxury
hotel.
</p>
<p>
He will then proceed to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for tea. At 5pm, PM Modi
and China's Xi will visit the four iconic monuments of Mamallapuram.
</p>
<p>
They will visit Arjuna's penance, Krishna's butter ball, Panchratha and the shore
temple. All the monuments have been cleaned. Wooden walkways have been set up
for the leaders to enjoy the heritage sites.
</p>
<p>
Natural grass lawns have been used in the landscaping. Lights have been installed as
well to add to the photo opportunities there.
</p>
<p>
A Buddha statue has been installed near the shore temple to add to the cultural
exchange between India and China.
</p>
<p>
After the leaders visit the monuments, a cultural programme will be conducted at the
shore temple. This will be followed by dinner at Fishermen's Cove where Prime
Minister Narendra Modi is staying.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, the leaders will start their day with an informal meeting followed by lunch.
Trade, terrorism, and border issues are topics that the two leaders are likely to discuss.
</p>
<p>
However, tourists have been left disappointed because movement has been restricted
at the monuments till the completion of the VVIP visit. Tourists can admire the
monuments only from outside.
</p>
<p>
<b>"We are from Kolkata. We went to Puducherry and then came here but we haven't
been allowed to see anything. This is disappointing. They should have put up notices
online at least wecould have then planned accordingly," </b>said Sharmista, a tourist.
</p>
<p>
As President Xi is to take the Old Mahabalipuram Road and the East Coast Road to
reach Mamallapuram, the entire route has received a makeover.
</p>
<p>
The medians have been painted, new sign boards and reflectors have been erected,
over-grown shrubbery and branches have been cut, and earth movers have been used
to remove thick shrubbery. CCTV cameras have also been installed along the way. The
road leading to the Fishermen's Cove also has new pavements.
</p>

The Agenda
</font></h2>
<p>
In the Mamallapuram summit, the focus of the talks is likely to be on steps to ensure
mutual development and expanding overall ties. The focus of the meeting is on
improving people to people contact and on how to maintain peace and tranquillity on
the India-China border.
</p>
<p>
PM Modi will hold one-to-one and delegation level talks with the Chinese President.
The meeting between them has no specific agenda but issues like terrorism, terror
funding, support and sourcing are likely to come up during the meet.
</p>
<p>
The two leaders are likely to decide dates for the next Special Representatives during
the informal meeting in Tamil Nadu later this week.
